# Agens UI Standards

## 1. Persistent User Menu Dropdown
- The user menu dropdown must appear on **every page** of the application.  
- The dropdown should remain consistent in design, accessibility, and behavior across all routes.   

## 2. Hand Gesture Cursor for Clickable Elements
- All clickable elements (links, buttons, icons, etc.) must use a **hand gesture cursor** instead of the default pointer.  
- This ensures users can instantly recognize interactive elements.
