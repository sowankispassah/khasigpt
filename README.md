# KhasiGPT

KhasiGPT is an AI assistant tailored for Khasi speakers. It blends localised language understanding with a polished web experience, giving communities in Northeast India a modern tool for translation, writing, and research in their own language. The project ships with a production-ready Next.js stack, an admin console for managing models and billing, and a responsive UI designed for both desktop and mobile.


## Why KhasiGPT?

- **Culturally aware AI** – prompts, tone, and default copy are written with Khasi speakers in mind so conversations feel natural.
- **Runtime model catalog** – add OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or other AI SDK models from the admin panel without redeploying.
- **Flexible monetisation** – prepaid credits, recurring plans, and usage dashboards help sustain the service.
- **Responsive UX** – persistent user menu, mobile-friendly drawers, and accessibility-first components from shadcn/ui.
- **Secure accounts** – email verification, optional Google OAuth, and password resets via Brevo transactional emails.
