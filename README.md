# KhasiGPT

KhasiGPT is an AI assistant tailored for Khasi speakers. It blends localised language understanding with a polished web experience, giving communities in Northeast India a modern tool for translation, writing, and research in their own language. The project ships with a production-ready Next.js stack, an admin console for managing models and billing, and a responsive UI designed for both desktop and mobile.


## Why KhasiGPT?

- **Culturally aware AI** – prompts, tone, and default copy are written with Khasi speakers in mind so conversations feel natural.
- **Runtime model catalog** – add OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or other AI SDK models from the admin panel without redeploying.
- **Flexible monetisation** – prepaid credits, recurring plans, and usage dashboards help sustain the service.
- **Responsive UX** – persistent user menu, mobile-friendly drawers, and accessibility-first components from shadcn/ui.
- **Secure accounts** – email verification, optional Google OAuth, and password resets via Brevo transactional emails.


## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router, Server Actions, React Server Components)
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix primitives
- **AI SDK:** Vercel AI SDK with streaming, tool calls, and structured outputs
- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) with Email + OAuth providers
- **Database:** Neon/PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- **Storage:** Vercel Blob for uploads
- **Tooling:** TypeScript, pnpm, Biome, Playwright, Vitest


## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. **Generate a `.env.local`**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Fill in the required secrets (see the table below).
3. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```
4. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000/register to create the first admin user.


## Environment Variables

All keys are documented in `.env.example`. Common values include:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Session encryption for Auth.js |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public base URL, used for share links and emails |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Provider credentials for chat models |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon or PostgreSQL connection string |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` / `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL` | Transactional email for verification and reset flows |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Vercel Blob storage access |

Run `pnpm lint` or `pnpm test` to check for missing configuration before deployment.


## Key Features

- **Chat workspace** – rich text composer with file uploads, model switching, and streaming responses.
- **Model selector** – admins seed model configs; users switch between available models directly in the chat input.
- **Admin console** – manage users, content pages (About, Terms, Privacy), pricing plans, and contact submissions.
- **Billing + usage** – prepaid recharge, plan upgrades, and detailed usage analytics for every account.
- **Content management** – About page, resources, and support forms managed from the same dashboard.
- **Internationalisation ready** – language-specific copy lives in database entries so translators can localise without code changes.


## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Next.js dev server |
| `pnpm build` | Create an optimised production build |
| `pnpm start` | Run the production server |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Biome linting and formatting checks |
| `pnpm test` | Execute automated tests (Vitest / Playwright) |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply Drizzle migrations to the configured database |


## Deployment

- Deploy directly to Vercel (recommended). Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
