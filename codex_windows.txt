Running Codex on Windows
Best practices for running Codex on Windows
For best performance on Windows, install and use
Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL2).
Codex is trained to operate in Unix-style environments; running inside WSL2 gives you a Linux shell, unix-style semantics, and tooling that match how Codex is designed to work best.
For example, when running Codex CLI on Linux, the agent can take advantage of built-in Linux sandboxing to automatically edit files while constraining edits to your workspace or run commands network-disabled.
Using Codex IDE extension with WSL
Codex IDE extension includes first-class WSL support. To make sure any commands the agent runs come from your Linux environment (instead of spawning Windows shells), add the following to your VS Code
settings.json
(run
Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)
from the Command Palette):
{
"chatgpt.preferWsl"
:
true
}
When this flag is set, the extension automatically launches the agent inside WSL, so its terminal sessions, sandboxing, and file edits all happen in the Linux workspace. If you don’t have WSL installed or enabled, the extension will recommend that you enable it with a prompt:
Using Codex CLI with WSL
Run these commands in an elevated PowerShell or Windows Terminal:
# Install default Linux distribution (like Ubuntu)
wsl
--
install
# Start a shell inside of Windows Subsystem for Linux
wsl
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl
# Install Node.js in WSL
curl

nvm
/
master
/
install.sh
|
bash
# In a new tab or after exiting and running `wsl` again to install Node.js
nvm install

# Install and run Codex in WSL
npm i

Work on code inside WSL
Working in Windows-mounted paths like
/mnt/c/…
can be slower than when working in them in Windows. Keep your repos under your Linux home directory (like
~/code/my-app
) for faster I/O and fewer symlink/permission issues:
mkdir
-p
~/code
&&
cd
~/code
git
clone
https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd
repo
If you need Windows access to files, they’re under
\wsl$\Ubuntu\home&lt;user>
in Explorer.
Launch VS Code from inside WSL
For a detailed walkthrough, follow the
official VS Code WSL tutorial
.
Prerequisites
Windows with WSL installed - we recommend an Ubuntu distribution. Install by shift+clicking on Powershell to open as an Administrator, then running
wsl --install
.
VS Code with the
WSL extension
installed.
Open VS Code from a WSL terminal
# From your WSL shell
cd
~/code/your-project
code
.
This opens a WSL remote window, installs the VS Code Server if needed, and ensures integrated terminals run in Linux.
Confirm you’re connected to WSL
Look for the green status bar that shows
WSL: <distro>
.
Integrated terminals should display Linux paths (such as
/home/...
) instead of
C:\
.
You can verify with:
echo
$WSL_DISTRO_NAME
which should print your distribution name.
If you don’t see “WSL: …” in the status bar, press
Ctrl+Shift+P
, pick
WSL: Reopen Folder in WSL
, and keep your repo under
/home/...
(not
C:\
) for best performance.
Running Codex on Windows: common patterns
For Codex CLI, start
wsl
then
cd
into your project and run
codex
to use of Linux-based sandboxing.
For Codex IDE extension, the default mode
Chat
will ask you to approve file edits and running commands. Or you can select
Agent (full access)
- exercise caution when using this as this allows the agent to run unsandboxed without approval.
Recommended model
On Windows, we recommend using
gpt-5
with
medium
reasoning (the Windows default for CLI versions >=
0.45.0
and VS Code extension versions >=
0.4.19
).
Troubleshooting & FAQ
Installed extension, but it’s unreponsive
Your system may be missing C++ development tools, which some native dependencies require:
Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload)
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)
With winget:
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools -e
Then fully restart VS Code after installation.
If it feels slow on large repos
Make sure you’re not working under
/mnt/c
. Move the repo to WSL (e.g.,
~/code/…
).
Allocate more memory/CPU to WSL if constrained; update WSL to latest:
wsl
--
update
wsl
--
shutdown
VS Code in WSL can’t find
codex
Verify the binary exists and is on PATH inside WSL:
which
codex
||
echo
"codex not found"
If the binary is not found, try installing by
following the instructions
earlier in this guide.
